"""16. Collect a three-digit number and print if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3-
- Example: if the number 123 is entered, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so "divisible by 3" will be printed
If the number 124 is entered, the sum is 7, so "not divisible by 3" will be printed"""



"""17. collect a string and check if it is reversable (for example: "Abba" reversed to Abba).
- Example: If the string "Abba" was received, the answer would be inverted to "Abba"
If the string "hello" was received, the answer will be "unreversible."""
